"""Create argparse compatible configuration objects of objects in Python as
determined by their docstring.
"""
import argparse

# TODO create the dectorator @config that wraps any function or class, takes
# the docstring, optionally checks if docstring roughly matches class to avoid
# issues mismatching docstring to object, and optionally creates the argparse
# parser for that object using the information from the docstring.

# TODO check primitives, confirm all primitives and basic numpy dtypes are as
# stated in docstring
