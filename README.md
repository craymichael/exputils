## Experiment Utils

Convenient scripts and functions that are commonly used in code for running experiments.

The main components are:

- io: nest namespaces in argparse, ease of saving JSONs, default arg parser, logging, and eventually profiling helpers (e.g. runtime at least)
- data: kfold cv wrapper and abstract data class
- visuals: Visualization scripts for common plots via pyplot
